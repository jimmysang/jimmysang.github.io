			<h1>Hi there, I'm Jimmy Sang!</h1>
			<p>I'm current a Boston University student pursuing Master Degree in Computer Science. </p>
			<p>I am looking for an intern as software developer.</p>

			<h2>Here is my story:</h2>
			<p>
			I came from China. I started using computer when I was only 6 years old. I like computers and internet not only because I love playing games on them but also because it is so cool magical compared to normal real world.

            <p>Computer is always with me all the way util my graduation from college and start my career. Then I realized that my first job was not that related to computers, neither was my major. So I just decided to change my career against my parents and became a software engineer.</p>

            <p>Now I really enjoy my works.</p>
