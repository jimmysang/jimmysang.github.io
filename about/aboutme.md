## About me

I came from China. I started using computer when I was only 6 years old. I like computers and internet not only because I love playing games on them but also because it is so cool magical compared to normal real world.

Computer is always with me all the way util my graduation from college and start my career. Then I realized that my first job was not that related to computers, neither was my major. So I just decided to change my career against my parents and became a software engineer.

Now I really enjoy my works.
